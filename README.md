  # Welcome to Angular workshop

## Requirements to work with angular: 

- Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later.
- Angular uses type script language and it has a big library. 
- You are already familiar with HTML, CSS,JavaScript, and some of the tools from the latest standards, such as classes and     modules. The code samples are written using TypeScript. Most Angular code can be written with just the latest JavaScript,   using types for dependency injection, and using decorators for metadata.

## Start learning Angular: https://angular.io/start   

 following Angular website tutorials is the best advice I can pass to any junior developer it has all the details that can be used to learn this new technology! Where you can practice your first Angular projects!
I learned that from days of following the wrong tutorials!

# CLI Angular: 

 the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. 

To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal.

To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

more about CLI : https://angular.io/cli


### Step 1: Install the Angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli

### Step 2: Create a workspace and initial application
ng new my-app

### Step 3: Run the application
cd my-app ng serve --open

# Components

	Components define areas of responsibility in the user interface, or UI, that let you reuse sets of UI functionality.
	

	A component consists of three things:
		- A component class: that handles data and functionality.

		-An HTML template: that determines the UI.
		
		-Component-specific styles: that define the look and feel.

### To generate new component with CLI
- ng generate component <name>
